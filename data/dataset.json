After you see a red card, you eliminate the BBR, BRB, RBB possibilities where you could have picked a black. The possibilities for what you could have picked are not equally likely. It's better to analyze the initial state. Let the cards be C1, C2, C3. Possible combos are (RRB), (RBR), (BRR), (BBR), (BRB), (RBB). Wait, the problem is simpler. There are 3 cards, at least one R and one B. So the possibilities are (RRB) or (RBB) (up to permutation). If it's (RRB) and you pick a Red, the other two are R,B. Switching has a 1/2 chance of getting Black. If it's (RBB) and you pick a Red, the other two are B,B. Switching guarantees a Black. This seems too complex. Let's simplify. The possibilities for the three cards are (Red, Red, Black) or (Red, Black, Black), in any order. Assume you picked C1 and it is Red. If the set was {R,R,B}, then C2,C3 is {R,B}. Switching gives you a 50% chance of getting a Black card. If the set was {R,B,B}, then C2,C3 is {B,B}. Switching gives you a 100% chance of getting a Black card. Without knowing the initial probability of RRB vs RBB, you can't solve it. The problem is ill-posed. Let's assume the combinations are equally likely: there are 3 ways to have RRB and 3 ways to have RBB. You pick a card at random. The probability that you pick a red is (2/3)*1/2 + (1/3)*1/2 = 1/2. Given that you picked a red, what is the probability the initial set was RRB? P(RRB|Red) = P(Red|RRB)*P(RRB)/P(Red) = (2/3)*(1/2)/(1/2)=2/3. P(RBB|Red)=1/3. So it is twice as likely that the set is RRB. If the set is RRB, one of the other cards is Black. If the set is RBB, both are Black. By switching, you are guaranteed to get a different color. No, this logic is also flawed. The simplest logic is: you have a Red card. You know there is at least one Black card among the other two. So there is either one B or two B's. By switching to a random other card, you have at least a 50% chance of getting a Black card. Sticking, you have a 0% chance. So you should switch." },
